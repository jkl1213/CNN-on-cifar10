# CNN-on-cifar10
We explore the comparison of linear models and nonlinear models on the classification of CIFAR10. The data contains 10 classes of images and we achieved an accuracy of 84% with CNN. 
SVM with linear kernel, CNN, KNN, and MLP are all implementated from scratch using basic packages such as numpy and pytorch.
